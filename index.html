            <div class="postcontent">
              <p>
I know, I know, eating animal is wrong, for the health, the environment, and the
animals themselves. However, I have been finding myself in a really difficult situation, because
I cannot stop thinking about the sexy chicken that I saw in the market place the other day. It was...
sexy... and not just like in those instragram accounts from horny teenages... no!! It was the most sexy
thing that I have seen in a long, long, long time!

           <div class="post-content">
             <p>
For a long time I was feeling like I don't belong to a place,
and it made me feel really guilty. However, not really belonging to
anywhere has given me freedom to live and to love without limits,
no matter where I am.

<em>My parents come from different states in Colombia</em>, and I was born in the capital city,
where neither of them belongs to. <strong>I was the only child</strong> in my family that was born in that city
and just a year after I was born we moved away from it. My father got a job in his hometown and we spent the
next 17 years living there. However, I never could feel like I fitted in my father's city.

it is placed by the Caribbean Sea and the Landscapes that surround it are really interesting.
